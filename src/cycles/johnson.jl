    simplecycles(dg::::IsDirected)

Compute and return all cycles of the given directed graph using Johnson's algorithm.

### Performance
The number of cycles grows more than exponentially with the number of vertices,
you might want to use the algorithm with a ceiling -- [`simplecycles_iter`](@ref) -- on large directed graphs
(slightly slower). If you want to have an idea of the possible number of cycles,
look at function `maxsimplecycles(dg::DiGraph, byscc::Bool = true)`. If you only need
short cycles of a limited length, [`simplecycles_limited_length`](@ref) can be more efficient.
