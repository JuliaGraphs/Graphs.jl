Compute a shortest path using the [A* search algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2A_search_algorithm).

# Arguments
- `g::AbstractGraph`: the graph
- `s::Integer`: the source vertex
- `t::Integer`: the target vertex
- `vertex_dist::Function`: an optional function returning the distance between the vertices `u` and `v` in `g`
- `heuristic::Function`: an optional function mapping each vertex to a lower estimate of the remaining distance from `v` to `t`. It is set to `v -> 0` by default (which corresponds to Dijkstra's algorithm)
