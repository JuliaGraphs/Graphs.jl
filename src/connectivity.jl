    isgraphical(degs)

Return true if the degree sequence `degs` is graphical.
A sequence of integers is called graphical, if there exists a graph where the degrees of its vertices form that same sequence.

### Performance
Time complexity: ``\\mathcal{O}(|degs|*\\log(|degs|))``.

### Implementation Notes
According to Erdös-Gallai theorem, a degree sequence ``\\{d_1, ...,d_n\\}`` (sorted in descending order) is graphic iff the sum of vertex degrees is even and the sequence obeys the property -
```math
\\sum_{i=1}^{r} d_i \\leq r(r-1) + \\sum_{i=r+1}^n min(r,d_i)
```
