Return a vector of edges comprising the shortest path between vertices `s` and `t`
using the [A* search algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2A_search_algorithm).
An optional heuristic function and edge distance matrix may be supplied. If missing,
the distance matrix is set to [`Graphs.DefaultDistance`](@ref) and the heuristic is set to
`n -> 0`.
