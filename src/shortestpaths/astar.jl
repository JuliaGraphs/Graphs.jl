    a_star(g, s, t[, distmx][, heuristic][, edgetype_to_return])

Compute a shortest path using the [A* search algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2A_search_algorithm).

# Arguments
- `g::AbstractGraph`: the graph
- `s::Integer`: the source vertex
- `t::Integer`: the target vertex
- `distmx::AbstractMatrix`: an optional (possibly sparse) `n Ã— n` matrix of edge weights. It is set to `weights(g)` by default (which itself falls back on [`Graphs.DefaultDistance`](@ref)).
- `heuristic::Function`: an optional function mapping each vertex to a lower estimate of the remaining distance from `v` to `t`. It is set to `v -> 0` by default (which corresponds to Dijkstra's algorithm)
- `edgetype_to_return::Type{E}`: the eltype `E<:AbstractEdge` of the vector of edges returned. It is set to `edgetype(g)` by default. Note that the two-argument constructor `E(u, v)` must be defined, even for weighted edges: if it isn't, consider using `E = Graphs.SimpleEdge`.
