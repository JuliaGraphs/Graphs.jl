Perform a breadth-first search of graph `g` starting from vertex `s`.
Return a vector of parent vertices indexed by vertex. If `dir` is specified,

### Performance
This implementation is designed to perform well on large graphs. There are
implementations which are marginally faster in practice for smaller graphs,
but the performance improvements using this implementation on large graphs
can be significant.

    gdistances!(g, source, dists; sort_alg=QuickSort)

Fill `dists` with the geodesic distances of vertices in `g` from source vertex (or
collection of vertices) `source`. `dists` should be a vector of length `nv(g)` 
filled with `typemax(T)`. Return `dists`.

For vertices in disconnected components the default distance is `typemax(T)`.

### Performance
`gdistances` uses `QuickSort` internally for its default sorting algorithm, since it performs
the best of the algorithms built into Julia Base. However, passing a `RadixSort` (available via
[SortingAlgorithms.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/SortingAlgorithms.jl)) will provide
significant performance improvements on larger graphs.
